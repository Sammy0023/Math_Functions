    <string name="square">In mathematics, a square is a geometric shape that has four equal sides and four equal angles. It is a type of quadrilateral, which means it has four sides. A square can be defined as a rectangle with all four sides of equal length, or as a rhombus with four right angles. Its properties include having parallel sides and opposite sides that are equal in length and perpendicular to each other. The area of a square is calculated by multiplying its length by its width, or by squaring the length of one of its sides. The perimeter of a square is calculated by adding the length of all four sides together.</string>
    <string name="oval">An oval is a geometric shape that is elongated and rounded, resembling an egg or an ellipse. It is a type of closed curve, which means it does not have any openings or corners. Ovals can be defined mathematically as a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from two fixed points, called foci. An oval\'s properties include having a major axis and a minor axis, which are the longest and shortest diameters, respectively. The distance between the two foci is equal to the length of the major axis.</string>
    <string name="triangle">In geometry, a triangle is a three-sided polygon, which means it is a closed shape with three straight sides and three angles. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always equal to 180 degrees. Triangles can be classified based on the length of their sides and the size of their angles. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles of 60 degrees each. An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal angles. A scalene triangle has no equal sides or angles.</string>
